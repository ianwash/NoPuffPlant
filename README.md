# No Puff Plant

# Welcome & About the App!
  Welcome to our No Puff Plant repository! Our app is designed to help those who vape reduce their intake. Through a modern yet cute, animated interface, the No Puff Plant allows users to set daily and weekly goals for how much they want to reduce their vape intake by. 
  This project was made using React Native and managed by Expo CLI. We implemented React Native’s “chart kit,” as well as the React Native animated library. This was our first app development project, and it has been a tremendous learning experience for both of us! 
  The app opens on the login page, from which users can login via existing account info, reset a forgotten password, or create a new account. New users are taken to the onboarding page, which asks then two fill out two small questions: how much they currently vape a day and their new goal. 
  Once onboarded and logged in to the app, each user can see an animated plant (watch it breathe!), which will represent their vape intake and goal progress. Every time a user vapes in a day, they can log it by holding the green vape button below the plant. At the end of each day, the vape count automatically resets. As users maintain and progress with their goal, their plant “levels up,” or grows a little! But be careful not to exceed your vape limit, or the plant will wither and get sad! 
  Through the stats dashboard, users can track their progress by viewing their vape intake for the last few days, past and current vape goals, and the current level the plant is on. Furthermore, the stats page shows users their “streak,” which measures how many days a user has met or stayed under their vape goal. Maintaining your streak count allows users to level up and breaking it causes users to return back to the lowest level. 
Lastly, the account info page allows users to view the email address associated with their account and the current goal they have set. Furthermore, the page displays an update goal option, with which users can change their vape goal. Users can also sign out from this page. 

# About the Creators & Personal Mission
  The creation of this app has been a personal endeavour for both of us. After Ian lost his mother and Ria lost their grandmother to lung cancer, lung health and surrounding topics have been greatly important to both of us. Furthermore, seeing the recent rise and prevalence of vape culture in our age group and its detrimental effects on vape users also inspired us to create this app. 
  We hope that No Puff Plant’s visually aesthetic and positive user interface will motivate users to reduce their intake, unlike other anti-vaping efforts, especially those rooted in more judgmental and aggressive methods. Our unique interface encourages users to quit vaping through a positive reinforcement system that fosters a sense of user-honesty, as our app aims to place a larger emphasis on positive goal setting. All in all, it has been so fun working on this app, and both of us are beyond excited to share this with our community! 

Happy planting, 
Ian & Ria :)
